# ThinkScript (Archived)

> **üì¶ Archived as of January 2024**

ThinkScript was an open-source community initiative aimed at empowering newcomers by helping them dive into open-source, learn through hands-on experiences, and grow with the guidance of mentors. Though we officially archived the project in **January 2024**, the impact of our work continues to live on through the developers, teams, and projects we supported.

## üå± Our Community Legacy  

ThinkScript was proudly **the first student-led tech community in our university**, setting a foundation for open learning and collaborative growth. 

We:

- Helped **newcomers break into open-source** by simplifying the onboarding process.
- Offered **mentorship programs** to develop practical coding skills and build confidence.
- Organized **Hackathons, Events, and Workshops** to foster creativity, collaboration, and continuous learning.
- Created a welcoming, inclusive environment for **learners, developers, designers, and mentors** alike.

Even though the platform is no longer active, our mission lives on in the people and projects we've helped launch.
